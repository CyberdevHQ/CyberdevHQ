#   Offensive Security & Digital Forensics

Welcome to my domain

I'm CyberDev, a Grey Hat Security Enthusiast pushing the boundaries of offensive security and digital forensics. I operate in the shadows to expose vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by those with malicious intent.

## üîÆ My Philosophy

The most effective security experts aren't limited by conventional boundaries. True system security can only be achieved by someone who can think and act like an attacker. I approach security with this grey hat mindset‚Äîfinding weaknesses where others see none, and protecting what matters most.

By mastering these fields, my goal is to **identify vulnerabilities, defend against cyber threats, investigate security incidents, and fortify systems** to create a more resilient cyberspace.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Arsenal

Currently, I am focused on learning and strengthening my cybersecurity skills through:
- **Offensive Security**: Web application exploitation, network penetration, wireless security assessment, and vulnerability discovery
- **Digital Forensics**: Evidence acquisition, artifact analysis, malware behavior tracking, incident reconstruction
- **Evolving Toolkit**: Continuously expanding across mobile hacking, hardware exploitation, and specialized security domains

Every challenge I take on brings me closer to becoming a **Red Team Expert** and an **Expert Grey Hat Hacker**. I believe the gray hat methodology is best approach companies, society etc should welcome and see as the best way to reach the top security layer.

## üéØ Mission

To become the Shadow Monarch of cybersecurity‚Äîan unstoppable force in offensive security who can infiltrate any digital fortress, understand its weaknesses, and then fortify it against all comers.

## üöÄ Always Learning, Always Growing & Philosophy

Each **line of code, exploit tested, vulnerability patched, and forensic trace analyzed** brings me closer to my goal. I believe in **continuous learning, hands-on experience, and knowledge-sharing** to strengthen cybersecurity worldwide.

Let's connect and collaborate to build a more **secure digital world**!

"Systems that cannot be tested without permission often remain vulnerable without knowledge." I believe in responsible discovery and disclosure that makes the digital world more secure, not less.
