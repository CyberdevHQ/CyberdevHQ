# 👋 Hello, Fellow Cybersecurity Enthusiasts!

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** and **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** with a mission to master both **offensive and defensive security**. I believe that to build truly secure systems, one must think like an attacker, defend like a blue teamer, and investigate like a forensic analyst. 

## 💡 Vision & Drive

My journey is driven by the belief that **security is a continuous battle** between attackers and defenders. To truly secure digital spaces, I aim to specialize in:
- **Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing** (Offensive Security)
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response** (Defensive Security & Investigation)
- **Linux Administration & System Hardening** (Strengthening Infrastructure)

By mastering these fields, my goal is to **identify vulnerabilities, defend against cyber threats, investigate security incidents, and fortify systems** to create a more resilient cyberspace.

## 🛡️ Security Journey

Currently, I am focused on learning and strengthening my cybersecurity skills through:
- **Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing** (Exploiting and securing systems)
- **Network & Web Application Security** (Understanding attack vectors & mitigation)
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response** (Tracing attackers & analyzing breaches)
- **Linux Administration & Hardening** (Strengthening system defenses)
- **Red vs. Blue Team Simulations** (Understanding both attack and defense strategies)

Every challenge I take on brings me closer to becoming a **Purple Team Expert**—combining **offensive, defensive, and forensic security** to fight against cyber threats effectively.

## 🔐 Current Project: Password Manager App (paused for now)

I'm currently working on **CycleCipher**—a project focused on making **password security intuitive and unbreakable**. This isn't just another password manager; it's my vision of **how security should be both powerful and user-friendly**.

Stay tuned for updates!

## 🚀 Always Learning, Always Growing

Each **line of code, exploit tested, vulnerability patched, and forensic trace analyzed** brings me closer to my goal. I believe in **continuous learning, hands-on experience, and knowledge-sharing** to strengthen cybersecurity worldwide.

Let's connect and collaborate to build a more **secure digital world**!
